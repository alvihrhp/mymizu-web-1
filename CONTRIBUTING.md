# 1. **Welcome**

**mymizu Open-Source Web App**

Welcome to mymizu.  Thank you for your interesting in contributing to our project!

# 2. How to get started

Please checkout the [README](https://github.com/mymizu/mymizu-web/blob/main/README.md) file for information about running the app and to setup a local development environment.

Check out the issues list on github for features to work on including spec and design information:
[Issues](https://github.com/mymizu/mymizu-web/issues).

If you have any questions regarding features, feel free to comment directly on the issues or ask in our [Slack community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y87ByAJrkfp2Hk3idfg4bx1t3iDfrO5bEu9zmKv9ewg/prefill).

If it's your first time contributing, please feel free to reach out in Slack to ask for suggestions about what to start on.  We'd suggest starting on a smaller feature or bug fix to get started! 

# 3. Reporting bugs

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new). 
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own.

After it's submitted:
- The project team will check the report and verify if it can be reproduced
- If it cannot be reproduced, we may ask for more details to investigate.
- If it can be reproduced, it will be marked as needing fixing, and the issue will be open for contributers to fix!

# 4. Suggesting new features/enhancements

We also use GitHub issues to store information about features we'd like to add in the future.

- Please check if anybody has already suggested a similar idea before!
- Open an [Issue](/issues/new). 
- Provide a detailed description of the feature that you want to propose.
- If it's useful, please provide screenshots or screen recordings to help show what you want to improve.
